I'm runnin' out of faith
Be careful who you tell
I'm runnin' out of faith
Be careful who you tell

She's blackenin' my name
My army never came
It's water under the bridge
Be careful who you tell

'Cause you gotta look her in the eye
And you gotta love your way of life
'Cause you gotta guilty, filthy soul
Don't you know it's out of your control

She's blackening my name
I know you feel the same
It's water under the bridge
Be careful who you tell

Stop squeezin' on my neck
Your unemployment check
It's water under the bridge
Be careful who you tell

'Cause you gotta look her in the eye
And you gotta love your way of life
'Cause you gotta guilty, filthy soul
Don't you know it's out of your control

Waiting on a bloodline
You can find some free time
Look at who you're hating
Now you're celebrating

Waiting on a bloodline
You can find some free time
Waiting on a bloodline
Waiting on a bloodline
Waiting on a bloodline

She's blackening my name
Be careful who you tell
'Cause you gotta look her in the eye
And you gotta love your way of life
'Cause you gotta guilty, filthy soul
Don't you know it's out of your control
