Now, Whoa

Have you ever felt something Evil, Lurking around
The Moon is full and The streets are empty
Shadows cover the town

You can't call it, You can't shake the feeling
Quiet, do not make a sound
But the wind seems to speak
Something's here in the room with me

Yep
I know that something is wrong here
I can feel it, but No one believes me
I know that something is strange here
I can sense it, but No one believes me

Oh, Um,
Whoa No one believes me... yeahhhh
WhoaNo one believes me... yeahhhh
Oh
No one believes me
No one believes me

What!
No one believes me
No one believes me
Whoa
Oh
(I am not crazy, I mean I'm, I'm not)
Oh
(I'm inside your fears)
Oh
(I've been watching you)
Oh
(I've been watching you too)
Oh, Whoa
And No one believes me

I feel like something is wrong here
I can sense it, but No one believes me
Whoa, Oh, Um

I'm not crazy, and no I'm not looney
I'm not insane
I take a second
I heard it, I know it
Whispers see my name

And the moon calling for me
And I'm scared where do I go, Where should I run
It's in front, in the front of me
No one's there
Where do I go, Where should I run
